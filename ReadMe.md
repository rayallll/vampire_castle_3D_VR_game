# The Elderwood
A first-person perspective 3D VR tower defense game is available exclusively on Windows PC.

## Project Description <br>
- **Project Type**: Bachelor School Project in Queen's University CISC 496 - VR Tower Defense Game.
  
- **Project Motivations**: 
Combining Tower Defence, 3D, and VR features would be really interesting because the game strategy and gameplay will be very different. Players can only see a small portion of the map instead of an overhead view.

## Project Summary
- **Completed Functionalities**:<br>
  Character movement and viewpoint control.<br>
  Enemy movement paths.<br>
  Building indoor structures avoiding collisions.<br>
  UI elements including the main interface, tower selection, and round number.<br>
  Gameplay mechanics implemented with C# scripts.<br>
  
- **Project Goal**:<br>
To develop an engaging VR tower defense game that combines strategic gameplay, immersive environments, and resource management. The game encourages players to think strategically about tower placement and upgrades to fend off waves of enemies and protect the heart.
  
- **Language Package**:<br>
**Developing Tool**: *Unity* <br>
**Developing Language**: *C#* <br>
**Design Tool**: *Blender, Mixamo, Procreate*<br>

## Project Feature
**1. First-Person Perspective VR Gameplay**

Players control their characters using the keyboard (W, A, S, D) for movement. If time allows, the game will also be adapted for VR handle operation. The immersive first-person perspective enhances the player's engagement with the game environment and the strategic elements of tower placement.<br><br>

**2. Strategic Tower Defense Mechanics**

Players can place various types of towers along the road to attack and block enemies. These towers are immune to enemy attacks and require gold coins to build and upgrade. At the start of the game, players are given a certain amount of gold coins, which can be increased by collecting coins produced by certain towers or dropped by defeated enemies.<br><br>

**3. Resource Management**

Gold coins are crucial for building and upgrading towers. Players must collect coins dropped by enemies and produced by towers. The initial amount of gold coins and the distance from which they can be collected can be increased using a Magic Wand, which can also be upgraded to enhance player movement speed.<br><br>„ÄÅ

**4. Diverse Tower Types**
There are four types of towers:
Attack Towers: Deal damage to enemies every second.
Freezing Towers: Slow down or freeze enemies every three seconds.
Gold-Producing Towers: Generate gold coins every second.
Range Damage Towers: Deal area damage to enemies every three seconds.<br><br>


**5. Enemy Dynamics**
Enemies move along a set path towards the heart. Players must strategically place towers to prevent enemies from reaching and destroying the heart. Different enemy types, including small and large monsters, have varying HP and drop different amounts of gold coins upon defeat. <br><br>

**6. Educational Tutorial System**
A detailed tutorial system helps players understand the controls, objectives, and mechanics of the game, ensuring a smooth learning curve and an enjoyable experience from the start.<br><br>

**7. VR Implementation**
Applying VR functionalities, enhancing the immersive experience, and ensuring compatibility with VR devices. <br><br>

**8. Cybersickness Prevention**

- **Environment Setup**:<br>
To run the project, you need to set up the following environment: <br>
**1. Prerequisites**:<br>
**Operating System**: Windows PC. <br>
**VR Headset**: Meta Quest 2, Oculus Rift S, or any OpenXR-compatible headset with connected controllers. <br>
**2. Setup Instructions**:<br>
**Clone Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub.<br>
**Connect VR Headset**: Connect any version of Meta headset (or any OpenXR headset) to your PC.<br>
**Load Headset**: Ensure your headset is fully loaded and can display your PC desktop.<br>
**Launch Game**: Open the *Vampire Castle.exe file* from your PC to launch the game, but do not wear the headset yet.<br>
**Start Game**: Using your mouse, click the 'Start Game' button on your PC screen. You should see a white ground scene displayed on your PC.<br>
**Wear Headset and Ready to Play**:  Now, wear the VR headset. You are now ready to play the game!<br>

## Game Controls
- **Movement**: Use [W][A][S][D] or the arrow keys to move around the map.
- **Tower Placement**: Click on the desired location to place a tower.
- **Upgrade Tower**: Click on an existing tower to upgrade it.
- **Collect Coins**: Walk over coins to collect them.

## Iterative Design
- **Unit Test**:
Implemented unit tests to ensure the reliability of game mechanics, including character movement, tower functionality, and enemy behavior. Gathered feedback from initial players to refine the game. Additionally, 15 players tested the application for 3 rounds, providing valuable feedback for further improvements.
